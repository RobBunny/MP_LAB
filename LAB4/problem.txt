    Every function follows this typical structure:
my_function:
    push rbp          ; Save base pointer
    mov rbp, rsp       ; Establish new stack frame
    ; (Optionally) push any registers you will modify
    ; function body
    ; (Optionally) pop saved registers
    pop rbp            ; Restore caller's frame pointer
    ret                ; Return to caller
