RBX     EBX     BX      BH/BL            Base; data storage, memory addressing
RCX     ECX     CX      CH/CL            Counter for loops, string operations
RDX     EDX     DX      DH/DL            I/O, multiplication/division
RSI     ESI     SI      SIL              Source index for string/data operations
RDI     EDI     DI      DIL              Destination index for string/data operations
RBP     EBP     BP      —                Base pointer for stack frames
RSP     ESP     SP      —                Stack pointer
R8–R15  R8D–    R8W–    R8B–R15B         Additional general-purpose registers (64-bit only)

Data Movement Instructions
--------------------------

Instruction         Syntax          Purpose
mov dest, src       mov rax, rbx    Copies data from src to dest. Can be register, memory, or immediate.
push reg/mem        push rbp        Pushes value onto stack; decrements rsp by 8 (64-bit).
pop reg             pop rbp         Pops value from stack into register; increments rsp by 8.



Arithmetic Instructions
-----------------------

Instruction         Syntax          Purpose
add dest, src       add rax, rbx    Adds src to dest and stores result in dest.
sub dest, src       sub rax, rbx    Subtracts src from dest.
mul src             mul rbx         Unsigned multiply rax * src. Result stored in rdx:rax.
imul src            imul rbx        Signed multiply. Can store result in rax or another register.
div src             div rbx         Unsigned divide rdx:rax / src. Quotient → rax, remainder → rdx.
idiv src            idiv rbx        Signed division.
